# Possible_languages

The script ```howmany.py``` can be used to calculate the number of possible languages compatible with the dataset. Simply call:

```python3 howmany.py n```

Where *n* is the number of parameters that you want to consider, starting from the top.
The program quickly runs to the first 30 parameters, but higher numbers might not return a result, because the complexity of the breadth-fist search algorithm used is *O(3^n)*.
